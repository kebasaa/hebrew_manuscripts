"""Build the Hebrew lexicon index Milah ships with.

Three openly licensed sources are folded into one compact JSON file:

* Strong's Hebrew Dictionary (public domain, 1890), as published by the
  OpenScriptures project, for the entry text of each number.
* The Westminster Leningrad Codex with morphology (OpenScriptures morphhb,
  CC BY 4.0), for the inflected forms each number actually appears as.
* TBESH, the Translators Brief lexicon of Extended Strongs for Hebrew
  (STEPBible.org, CC BY 4.0) — an abridged Brown-Driver-Briggs — for the gloss
  a reader actually wants, Strong's 1890 wording being both dated and slanted
  towards KJV renderings.

The result is committed as ``app/data/hebrew_lexicon.json`` and compiled into
the binary as a Qt resource; the raw downloads are not kept. Run it again only
when the upstream data changes.

Usage, run from a milah checkout with this repository beside it::

    python ../hebrew_manuscripts/tools/python/tools/build_lexicon.py \\
        --strongs  <dir>/strongs-hebrew-dictionary.js \\
        --wlc      <dir>/wlc \\
        --tbesh    <dir>/tbesh.txt \\
